<br> 
<br>1. Definitions
<br>a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
<br>b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
<br>c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
<br>d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
<br>e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
<br>f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
<br> 
<br>2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
<br> 
<br>3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
<br>a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
<br>b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
<br>c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
<br>d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
<br>e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
<br>i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
<br>ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
<br>f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
<br> 
<br>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
<br> 
<br>4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
<br>a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.
<br> 
<br>b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
<br> 
<br>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
<br>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br> 
<br>6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br> 
<br>7. Termination
<br>a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
<br> 
<br>b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
<br> 
<br>8. Miscellaneous
<br>a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
<br>b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
<br>c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
<br>d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
<br>e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
<br> 
<br>Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
<br> 
<br>Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

<br>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
<br>-----------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br>PREAMBLE
<br>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
<br>development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
<br>efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
<br>open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
<br>with others.
<br> 
<br>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
<br>redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
<br>fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
<br>redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
<br>names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
<br>however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
<br>requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
<br>to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
<br> 
<br>DEFINITIONS
<br>"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
<br>Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
<br>include source files, build scripts and documentation.
<br> 
<br>"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
<br>copyright statement(s).
<br> 
<br>"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
<br>distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
<br> 
<br>"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
<br>or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
<br>Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
<br>new environment.
<br> 
<br>"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
<br>writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
<br> 
<br>PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
<br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
<br>a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
<br>redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
<br>Software, subject to the following conditions:
<br> 
<br>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
<br>in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
<br> 
<br>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
<br>redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
<br>contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
<br>included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
<br>in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
<br>binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
<br> 
<br>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
<br>Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
<br>Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
<br>presented to the users.
<br> 
<br>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
<br>Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
<br>Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
<br>Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
<br>permission.
<br> 
<br>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
<br>must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
<br>distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
<br>remain under this license does not apply to any document created
<br>using the Font Software.
<br> 
<br>TERMINATION
<br>This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
<br>not met.
<br> 
<br>DISCLAIMER
<br>THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
